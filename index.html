                <p class="mainpara-section"> Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education and
                    the provincial governments, while the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development,
                    accreditation and the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of
                    Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age
                    group 5 to 16 years.</p>

                <p class="mainpara-section1"> Only about 67.5% of Pakistani children finish primary school
                    education.[16] The standard national system of education is mainly inspired from the English
                    educational system. Pre-school education is designed for 3â€“5 years old and usually consists of three
                    stages: Play Group, Nursery and Kindergarten (also called 'KG' or 'Prep'). After pre-school
                    education, students go through junior school from years 1 to 5. This is followed by middle school
                    from years 6 to 8. At middle school, single-sex education is usually preferred by the community, but
                    co-education is also common in urban cities. The curriculum is usually subject to the institution.
                    The eight commonly examined disciplines are:.</p>

                <p class="mainpara-section2"> Most schools also offer drama studies, music and physical education but
                    these are usually not examined or marked. Home economics is sometimes taught to female students,
                    whereas topics related to astronomy, environmental management and psychology are frequently included
                    in textbooks of general science. Sometimes archaeology and anthropology are extensively taught in
                    textbooks of social studies. SRE is not taught at most schools in Pakistan although this trend is
                    being rebuked by some urban schools. Provincial and regional languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi,
                    Pashto and others may be taught in their respective provinces, particularly in language-medium
                    schools. .</p>
